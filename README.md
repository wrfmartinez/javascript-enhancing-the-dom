# JavaScript: Enhancing the DOM
Solutions to exercises within the LinkedIn Learning course by Maaike van Putten.

### Course Description
The Document Object Model (DOM) is at the core of every webpage. To develop dynamic HTML pages, a front-end developer should understand how JavaScript connects and lets you control the DOM to create, modify, delete, and edit existing content on a page. In this course, designed for experienced web designers and developers, instructor Maaike van Putten provides an overview of basic DOM elements, how JavaScript gives you access to the elements, and how to work with the DOM to create dynamic webpages.

Learn the fundamental skills required for selecting DOM elements, traversing the DOM, modifying DOM elements, and creating, adding, and managing nodes. Along the way, get tips on event handling, advanced DOM manipulation, accessibility, performance, and best practices. This includes a real-world project where you build an interactive resume app with a Node.js back end.
